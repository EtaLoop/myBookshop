# myBookshop

C++ LEARNING PROJECT

Goal here is to represent a bookshop using C++ objects.
As in a bookshop you can :
- Create collection and add book to it
- Search for a specific book


Try :
- 'new collection' to create a collection
- 'list collection' to list every collection


# How to use

- `make` (using g++)

- `./bookshop`
